# Sagittarius A-Star system

Using data from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09144), we can add some orbiting stars, and a dinky black hole, to the center of the milky way.

TODO:

-Check orientation of the system w.r.t to the milky way.
-Add more stars (currently 4)
-Maybe make them more star like?
