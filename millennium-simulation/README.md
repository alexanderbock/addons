# Millennium Simulation

This asset includes a speck file, and python script to make it, for results from the  [https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium](Millennium Simulation project).

Included is a sample speck file of just the first 10,000 rows from the data set. You can use the included python script to make larger speck files with more data points.

The full data set of galaxy coordinates is available [here](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/agnpaper/). It contains 9474168 galaxies which will create a speck file of about 400 Mb.
